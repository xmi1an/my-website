#### 18. Write Python programs to implement a concept of tuples.

```python
avengers = ("Ironman", 3000, True, "Wanda", "Hawkeye")
print(avengers)
print(type(avengers))
```

:::tip Reference
Python Tuple is used to store the sequence of immutable Python objects. The tuple is similar to lists since the value of the items stored in the list can be changed, whereas the tuple is immutable, and the value of the items stored in the tuple cannot be changed.
