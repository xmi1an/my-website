#### 19.Write a Python program to create nested list and display its elements.

```python
mynumbers = [
    [2, 3, 4],
    [5, 6, 7],
    [8, 9, 10]
]

for list in mynumbers:
    for number in list:

:::tip Reference

Nested List Comprehensions are nothing but a list comprehension within another list comprehension which is quite similar to nested for loops.
