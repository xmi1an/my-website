#### 13.Write Python programs to create functions and use functions in the program.

```python
# function definition
def msg():
    print("Hello Peter")

def sum(a, b):
    print(a + b)

# function calling
msg()
sum(5, 2)
```

:::tip Reference

- A function can be defined as the organized block of reusable code, which can be called whenever required.
- Python provides the def keyword to define the function.
